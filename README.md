# âŒš Yesterday

**Yesterday** is a platform for generating, keeping and distributing your project's changelogs!

## ðŸ’­ Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and by always having to create, manually, my own `CHANGELOG.md` and commit multiple bumps to it between releases.
